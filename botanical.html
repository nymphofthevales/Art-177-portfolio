            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> For this project I spent some time wandering around the east campus looking at whichever plants caught my eye. I did my best to identify them and took notes on their structures using my knowledge from the Biology class I also took this semester. Narcissus is not native to North America, but it seems to grow wild around here since I've seen it in a few places; probably spread from its common decorative usage. The cherry was clearly planted as a decorative plant, while the tree in the third drawing remains unidentified and unknown to me.
