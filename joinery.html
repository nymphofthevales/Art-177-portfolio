            <p><span class="sc">Subject:</span> Various wood joinery methods, cut into root vegetables for reference.
                </p>
            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> An investigation of isometric views and orthographic projection to give a good view on how to construct something. In class we carved root vegetables to join them with each other in order to have an easy physical reference for the drawings. I made a few joints with a potato, some quite neatly fitting, but unfortunately did not take photos of them, and only have the drawings to remember them by. A fun class.
