            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> For this project, I set out to walk around campus with my sketchbook and find a suitable situation; a place where the light shone through a gap right, perhaps, or the interior of a windowed stairwell. What I found, in contrast, was shadow. What follows are three sketches exploring the relationship between buildings and shadowâ€”the absence of light, its inseperable twin.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In the first two drawings, I was interested in the way the tree's organic shadows wrapped around the linear forms of the Cornett building and a statue placed nearby.</li>
                        <li>The other is a study of the Maclaurin building. I was attracted to the foreboding atmosphere of the building, produced by the brutalist design that pervades many of the buildings around campus. While light defines the ridges and outlines of the building, it is the heaviness of the dark in the windows, the shadow, that gives the drawing its visual interest.</li>
