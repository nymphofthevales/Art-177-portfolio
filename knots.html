            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> Similar to the MÃ¶bius strip, there's an interesting amount of math out there to describe knots geometrically. As a mathematician would, I first focused on abstracting the knots as far as possible from reality: to depict the overlapping patterns of rope with only one line passing through itself. This led me to a stylization inspired by Celtic knots, which I find quite pleasing, though the Reef knot proved difficult to adapt into this style.
