            <p><span class="sc">Subject:</span> Professor Gifford's collection of plaster casts of faces.
                </p>
            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> Professor Gifford first ran us through the exercise of drawing the same face in increasing intensities of light, causing the features to be washed out. The effect of the features "appearing" out of the light with each successive drawing was so stunning that I decided to combine my four drawings into a short looping animation, below. After that exercise, I jumped to my inks to attempt the chiaroscuro effect, and am delighted with the results. This was definitely my favourite class this term.
