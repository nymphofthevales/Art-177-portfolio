            <p><span class="sc">Notes:</span> For this project, I took a more abstract approach. This was motivated by three questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm interested in the simple objects around us, and what past they hold, what stories they can convey—what is the "soul" of an object?</li>
                    <li>The original project prompt asked for three sounds <i>made by the mouth</i>, but this begs the question: <i>what about sounds not made by the mouth?</i> What about sounds that can scarcely exist in reality, the sounds created in dreams and visions and imagination? How could these sounds be evoked, if not by the mouth?</li> 
                    <li>What constitutes a <i>symbol?</i> A symbol can be a drawn figure, like a letter or shape, but in the science of semiotics—the study of symbols and signs—a symbol can be anything that conveys meaning to the interpreter.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Thus in total my motivation became: how can seemingly mundane objects act as symbols, vessels for meaning, to convey otherwise unimaginable sounds or soundscapes? The result was these three illustrations.</p>
