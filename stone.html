                </p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe fluid system that my project tackles is that of <i>stone</i>, a metamorphosis and realization of stone as something light and fluid. This project includes a couple drawings, a looping animation, and a short essay fleshing out the subject and connecting a few different ideas.
